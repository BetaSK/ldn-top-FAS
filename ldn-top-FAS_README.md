This is a Matlab implementation of our paper:

"Face Anti-spoofing Based on Dynamic Color Texture Analysis Using Local Directional Number Pattern", submitted to TIFS, 2019.

### Requirements

1. MTCNN face detector: https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment
2. Matlab R2016b to reproduce our results, later version may lead to bias.

### Data Preparation

In this paper, we use three challenging public datasets, namely, [CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database (CASIA FASD)](https://pythonhosted.org/bob.db.casia_fasd/#), [Replay-Attack Database](https://www.idiap.ch/dataset/replayattack) and  [Unicamp Video-Attack Database (UVAD)]().  

Download the datasets and put them in ".\data\dataset\".
